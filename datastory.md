# Dear Director,

Imagine this: a packed theater, audiences glued to their seats, so captivated by the movie that they forget about their
popcorn, and critics raving about your latest masterpiece. What if we told you that the missing puzzle piece for creating
such a blockbuster might already be gathering dust on millions of bookshelves across the world, waiting to be brought to
life?

Book-based movies have a unique power: they can tap into an existing fanbase, provide a blueprint for the adaptation,
and have a proven track record of yielding more successful movies compared to non-book-based movies. However, not all
adaptations are created equal. While some are known by everyone, others fall short. What does it take to create the next
gem? That is where we come into play.

In the following, we will show that your next movie should be based on a book. We will explore how such films outperform
their non-adapted counterparts and uncover the most important factors to catapult your movie to the top. From genre choice
to popularity to narrative fidelity we will tell you what factors to consider to turn the book you choose into the next
blockbuster.
